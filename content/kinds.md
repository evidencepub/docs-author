# Kinds of Evidence

All Evidence publications are formally registered as **preprints** with Crossref (also known as posted-content), regardless of their specific features or classification. Once published, Evidence preprints are indexed and become discoverable and citable on major scholarly platforms, including Google Scholar.

The process for publishing a MyST-formatted preprint in Evidence depends significantly on the type of preprint you are submitting. The required steps and documentation vary based on the structural components of your work, such as the inclusion of code, datasets, interactive figures, dashboards, or other supplementary materials. 

Authors should carefully review the submission guidelines relevant to their preprintâ€™s structure to ensure a smooth publication process.
