# Welcome to Evidence

Building on the foundation of [NeuroLibre Reproducible Preprints](https://neurolibre.org), the Evidence Publication Platform is committed to advancing reproducible academic publishing.

## Towards a networked, woven literature

What remains of a publication when we remove the prose?

* In traditional literature, we’re left with a PDF containing isolated figures and citations that serve mainly for credit. For a more entertaining perspective, see this [blog post](https://qantarot.substack.com/p/chatgpt-and-galactica-are-taking).

* In the [woven literature](https://preprint.neurolibre.org/10.55458/neurolibre.00041), what remains is the actual code, data, and meaningful portions of other publications that **truly contribute** to the work.

Whether we call it [woven literature](https://preprint.neurolibre.org/10.55458/neurolibre.00041) or [networked open science publishing](https://docs.curvenote.com/publish/kinds#networked-science), next-generation scholarly publishing is already here to make the future of science [continious](https://continuousfoundation.org).

## What sets Evidence apart?

Since 2017, our goal has been to empower researchers to share their work in formats that **go beyond traditional PDFs**. While our technology has progressed, our dedication to this mission remains unchanged:

:class: tip

Preprints submitted to Evidence are categorized by their level of interactivity and computational content. Submissions can range from a straightforward _literature review_ with text and static figures ([example](https://preprint.neurolibre.org/10.55458/neurolibre.00041/)), to fully _computational articles_ featuring in-browser code execution ([example](https://preprint.neurolibre.org/10.55458/neurolibre.00033/)) and interactive dashboards ([example](https://preprint.neurolibre.org/10.55458/neurolibre.00029/)).

## What about Peer Review?

Our publication process includes basic moderation and technical screening.

Although Evidence does not assess the scientific merit of submissions as a preprint platform, it is integrated with numerous post-publication peer review platforms (distributed peer review) via the COAR-notify protocol.
